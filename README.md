# Reddit Scout
A small engine to look for regular expressions in subreddits, enjoy!<br>
This was developped as a personal script to be the first to get codes released in certain subreddits (It's always a bummer when you check for codes and they've already been used) 
<br>It may have way more usages, such as finding passwords, links to stuff... Be imaginative!

## Installation and execution

1. Clone the repository
2. Create an app in Reddit (you can call it whatever)
3. Fill in the config_example.py file with your credentials and rename it to config.py
4. Add the regular expressions you want to look for as strings in the PATTERNS field
5. Run main.py and enjoy!

## Future plans

Adding proper alerting
 - Telegram
 - Slack

Using it as the entry point of a pipeline
  - Redeeming the code automatically/writing to a file
